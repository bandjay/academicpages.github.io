In the summer of 2017, Jay worked at Mayo clinic as a Intern.There he was responsible to develop tools for data pipelines and enhance existing tools.<br/>
<br/>
Tool usage: Python, Unix, Perl, Selenium, beautiful soup, pptx<br/>
<br/>
At Mayo clinic, Jay worked on multiple projects and his major project was 'Automated Gene Report Generation'.Goal of this project is to automate the patient gene report (.pptx format) generation. Creating these reports is cumbersome as gene data comes from various sources such as files, web sites etc., and genetic counselors required these reports for analyzing genetic variations.
<br/> 
As obtaining gene data from multiple sources, creating a power point gene report is tedious and often gene counselors spend hours in preparing these reports. So through this project Jay automated pptx document generation using python to save time (saved ~ 3 hours per report)  such that gene counselors can spend more time with patients than to worry about making reports manually.
<br/>
Other than his major project,Jay developed enhancements for a "Metabolic Modelling tool".Also,Jay was part of Machine learning club at Mayo where he presented,discussed research work with peers. <br/>
