This section is about useful R and Python scripts for Data analysis,Machine learning and web scraping.
<br/>
<br/>
1) [New York Times web scraper.R](https://github.com/bandjay/NYtimes/blob/master/NYtimes_EveryDay_Scraper.R)  script for web scraping  NYT API, input custom Search Term like "Immigration", Start Date and run script to save articles data into CSV file.       
<br/>
2) [Data Viewer](https://github.com/bandjay/NYtimes/tree/master/DataViewer) Simple data viewing application using R, Shiny.Useful for reading text files with large content and input your text file in CSV format.
<br/> 
<br/>
3) [R_basics.R](https://github.com/bandjay/R-programming/blob/master/R_basics.R)  template script for Regular Expressions, dplyr and functional programming in R.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
5) [Caret_models.R](https://github.com/bandjay/R-programming/blob/master/Caret%20Pack-%20All%20algos.Rmd)  template for several machine learning models such as Elasticnet, GBM ,SVM with cross validation using R "caret" package.
<br/>​
<br/>
6) [h2o_ensemble.R](https://github.com/bandjay/R-programming/blob/master/h20.R) script for faster ensemble learning using several h2o models such as GLM.RF,GBM for binary classification.
<br/>
<br/>
