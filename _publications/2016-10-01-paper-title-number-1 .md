At present I am a Research Assistant to the College of Media at University of Illinois,and I have been working on Topic Classification,Sentiment Analysis on issues such as Privacy, Secrecy ,Immigration etc .Currently implementing data driven solutions using Machine Learning for  two projects 1)"Privacy VS Secrecy analysis" using data from twitter feeds 2) "Immigration Analysis" with data from the New York times articles. <br/>
Tools usage : R,Python,Markdown,Shiny,Spark,APIs <br/>
​1) Privacy VS Secrecy Analysis :<br/>
 Public sentiment/opinion about privacy ,secrecy has always been ambiguous ,for example in the incident of exposing a matter some people see it as a privacy matter which can be private where as others think of something is being hidden and the secret should be revealed to public. In real world public sentiment about Privacy and Secrecy can be overlapping or disjoint  so our study involves researching  three majors incidents "Ashley Madison Dating Website Hacking", "Celebrity Nude Photo Hacking", "Edward Snowden NSA leaks".Each of these incidents have different levels of overlapping in case of "Edward Snowden NSA leaks" the analysis revealed that the public treated him as hero because he exposed the NSA secret surveillance where as he is a traitor for revealing national secrets according to the government/law ,so no clear demarcation between Privacy and Secrecy w.r.to the public sentiment.Where as for the 'Ashley Madison Dating Website Hacking' majority of the public sentiment is towards the Secrecy because people think that extra martial affairs are more of hiding a secret to a private matter. <br/> 
We aim to distinguish the sentiment in different situations by using Machine Learning and Text Mining and develop a solution that can categorize tweets into one of the three classes "Privacy","Secrecy","Other" and thus analyze public sentiment using the machine generated classes. <br/>
​Below is the workflow for the Project <br/>
