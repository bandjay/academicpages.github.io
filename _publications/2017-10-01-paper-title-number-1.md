In the summer of 2017, Jay worked as an IT intern at Mayo clinic.There he was responsible to develop tools for data pipelines and enhance existing tools.
<br/>
Tool usage: Python, Unix, Perl, Selenium, beautiful soup, pptx
<br/>
At Mayo Jay worked on multiple projects and his major project was 'Automated Gene Report Generation'.Aim of this project is to automate patient gene report (.pptx format) generation with the use of  gene data coming from various sources such as files, web sites etc., and genetic counselors use these reports for analyzing genetic variations.
<br/> 
As obtaining gene data from multiple sources, creating a power point gene report is tedious and often gene counselors spend hours in preparing these reports. So through this project Jay automated pptx document generation using python to save time (~ 3 hours per report) for gene counselors such that they can spend more time with patients than to worry about making reports manually.
<br/>
Other than his major project,Jay developed enhancements for a "Metabolic Modelling tool".Also,Jay was part of Machine learning club at Mayo where he presented,discussed research work with peers.
