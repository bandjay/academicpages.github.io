**Tools**:
Python, REST APIs, Docker, Elastic Search , Mongo DB, Watson Discovery , Watson Assistant.<br/>
<br/>
**Methods**:Several NLP techniques such as 
* Extraction of Entities , Pivot sentences , Procedures , Symptoms, Conditional Blocks , Images and Tables. 
* Improving search relevance using Boosting and Learn2rank 
* Text classification using universal sentence encoder (USE) , Watson NLP<br/>
<br/>
**Description**:
There is a wide variety of technical documents being generated in the IT industry. In order to build generic AI solutions faster that can cater to various kinds of enterprise IT scenarios, there is a need to automatically and
generically extract the knowledge from technical documents. However challenges here include (a) the lack
of standardization in size, style, and organization in the documentation (b) specific structural patterns present
in IT documents that differentiate them from generic documents. To overcome these challenge of automated
understanding of technical documents, we propose a framework to represent technical documents, inspired
by how humans read and comprehend documents. We also detail on automatic extraction of components from technical documents, how they relate to each other and demonstrate the value by using two example applications: Search and Question Answering (QA) systems.​​<br/>
