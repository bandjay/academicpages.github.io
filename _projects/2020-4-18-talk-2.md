**Tools**:
Python, REST APIs, Docker, Mongo DB, Watson Assistant<br/>
<br/>
**Methods**:Several ML,NLP techniques such as 
* Extraction of Entities , Pivot sentences , Procedures , Symptoms, Conditional Blocks , Images and Tables. 
* Text classification using universal sentence encoder (USE) , Watson NLP classifier
* Seed based clustering using Gaussian Mixture Models<br/>
<br/>
**Description**:
This project involves two steps 1) Bootstrapping chat-bots with knowledge extracted from documents 2) Assessing chat-bot coverage and automatically identifying gaps in the bot's knowledge
* Knowledge Extraction from documents for Question Answering - Using technical documents we extract several QA pairs from pivot sentences, procedural sections, paragraphs, images, tables etc . These QA pairs will be used to bootstrapped chat-bot , which will will help agents to solve incidents/service requests. 
* Gap Analysis and allowing the SME to test the bot's knowledge- Once the chat-bot is bootstrapped , using an UI we enable the SME to see  what the bot has learnt from a given document in terms of QA pairs to approve the chat-bot or even SME can provide few annotations to enhance chat-bot coverage.<br/>

**Outcomes**:
* Client value OTAA award for contributing to client-success
* Bootstrapped chat-bot from approximately 100 technical documents and reduced chat-bot development time by 95 percent
<br/>
<br/>

**Realted Patents** :
* Framework for gap analysis of chat-bots
