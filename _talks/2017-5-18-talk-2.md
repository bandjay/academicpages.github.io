Key words: R, h2o , XGboost ,Sparklyr ​​<br/>
​​<br/>
This Project is a competition on DRIVENDATA, to predict which pumps are functional, which need some repairs, and which don't work at all. Predicting one of these three classes based on a number of variables about what kind of pump is operating, when it was installed, and how it is managed. A smart understanding of which water points will fail can improve maintenance operations and ensure that clean, potable water is available to communities across Tanzania.
​<br/>
Data cleaning was as performed such as<br/>
i) Removed some of the variables as they are constant or no variation<br/> 
ii) Some variables are similar to others such as latitude and longitude variables conveys location information ,so other redundant location variables were removed<br/>
iii) Some categorical variables have too many levels and such variables were discarded<br/>
iv) created new variables to account for age of pump based on installation date etc.,<br/>
After feature engineering ,Classification model was trained using Xgboost and  Random Forest using h2o, sparklyr packages and interpreted significant variables for classifying faulty water based on information gain.
